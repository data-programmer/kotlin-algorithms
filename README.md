# Kotlin Algorithms

This is a repository for algorithms I've created in the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) programming language. The algorithms included in this repository are for educational and review purposes.

# Setup

Simply clone the project using Git and open the project in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/). I have created a simple Kotlin console app that can execute examples of each algorithm in action.
